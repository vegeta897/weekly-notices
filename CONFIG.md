# üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The default contents of these files should illustrate their usage, but you should read this to make sure you understand everything. The bot will try to give you helpful errors if you have an invalid config. If you're new to JSON, you may want to [validate your file](https://jsonlint.com/) first.

## Schedule

The `schedule.json` file contains your scheduling data, which consists of two parts:

1. **Events** - An array of events that occur each week
2. **Notifications** - An array of timed notifications that occur for every event

There's also the `timezone` property, so the bot can correctly read your configured times. This must be a valid [IANA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) name (e.g. `"America/New_York"`, `"Europe/London"`, `"Japan"`).

### Events

Every event object must look like the following:

```json
{
  "name": "Tuesday night boss",
  "weekday": "tuesday",
  "hour": 20,
  "minute": 0
}
```

The `weekday` must be a day of the week, in lower-case.

The `hour` must be in 24-hour format, so 10PM at night would be `"hour": 22`

The `name` will be shown in the notification.

Don't forget to separate your event objects with a comma. [Validate your JSON!](https://jsonlint.com/)

### Notifications

Notification objects consist entirely of optional properties:

```json
{
  "minutesBefore": 10,
  "secondsBefore": 0,
  "roleMention": "everyone",
  "customMessage": "This is the final notice!"
}
```

This notification will trigger 30 minutes before every event, because it has `minutesBefore` set to `30`. You can also use `secondsBefore`, which will add with the minutes. These properties will default to `0` if not set (which causes a notification precisely when the event starts)

You can use negative values to send notifications after the event!

You can make the notification mention a @role with `roleMention`. You can use `"everyone"`, `"here"`, or the name of any mentionable role. Do not include `@` in the role name.

Lastly, you can attach a custom message to the notification. This will display in addition to the event name and how many minutes/seconds away it is.

## Bot

The `bot.json` file allows you to specify admins, target channels, and customize the rich embed.

`channels` is a list of channel IDs which the bot will send notifications to. These can be across different servers, but this bot is more suited for single-server usage. These IDs must be in string format, e.g. `"522278186147512322"`

`useEmbeds` specifies whether you want notification messages to use rich embeds. Set it to `false` to use plain text messages, which are smaller and visible to users who have turned off embeds.

If you are using embeds, you can customize the color and author name with `embedColor` and `embedAuthor`. The color must be a 6-digit hex value, like this `"F04F6F"`. Do not include `#` or `0x` in this value.

There is only one chat command, which is `s.reload`, but you can customize the prefix.

`admins` is an array of user IDs that have permission to use the reload command.
